# Using the CLI


## CLI Utilities
Other than the [GUI app](gui.html), we can also use the CLI utilities with the command:
```noformat
botroyale-cli
```

This gives us the option to automatically run many battles and produce winrates, and calculation times.

## Developer Options
If you are developing in a [dev environment](../contributing.html#dev-environment), there are several useful commands:

- `botroyale-docs` (create and show the docs locally)
- `botroyale-format` (format the source code to comply with enforced style)
- `botroyale-test` (run the test suite for integrating code upstream)

Add `--help` to these commands to see more details.
