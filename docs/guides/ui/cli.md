# Command Line Interface

## CLI Utility
Other than the [GUI app](gui.html), we can also have a CLI utility with the command:
```noformat
botroyale cli
```

This gives us options to automatically run many battles to produce winrates and calculation times.

## Developer Options
If you have [installed from source](../install.html#install-from-source), there are several useful commands for core developers. Add `--help` to these commands to see more details.

### Docs
Create and show the docs locally:
```noformat
botroyale docs
```

### Code format
Format the source code to comply with integration tests:
```noformat
botroyale format
```

### Tests
Run the integration test suite:
```noformat
botroyale test
```
