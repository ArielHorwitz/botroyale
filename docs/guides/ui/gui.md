# Using the GUI app

## Running the App
To run the GUI app, use the command:
```noformat
botroyale
```

This will open the app *and will only include the default bots*. To open the app with your own bots, see [this guide](../bots/simple.html).

## Main menu
After starting the app, you will see the main menu. This includes controls for selecting a map and which bots will play.

To play with any and all bots available, just press the "Start New Battle" button on the bottom left. You may select which bots should play by clicking on their names on the right. You may use "Filter bots" to search for specific bots.

Some bots are marked as "testing" and will only be available by clicking on "Enable testing bots".

## Watching battles
After starting a new battle, you will see an info panel and the battle map. Press the *spacebar* to start playing. Use the number keys 1-5 to set the game speed.

> **Important:** Some bots may take a long time to calculate their turns. If you wish to watch the battle smoothly, use "Battle > Preplay" in the top menu bar to pre-calculate the entire battle and watch from the beginning. ***The app may freeze for up to several minutes*** depending on the map size and bot calculation speed.

You can scroll backwards and forwards to watch a replay. Try using the *left* and *right* arrow keys to scroll forward and backwards in time. These are called "steps" of time. You can also use *control + left* and *control + right* to scroll to the ends of rounds.

Make sure to browse the top menu bar to see all the features and hotkeys.
