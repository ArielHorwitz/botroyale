# Installing Bot Royale

It is recommended to use a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). Once activated, install using:

```noformat
pip install --upgrade botroyale
```

That's it! You now have Bot Royale installed in Python. See the guide on [writing your first bot](bots/simple.html).

## Install from source
If you wish to develop on the botroyale package itself, install the project in *editable mode* from source with the "dev" extras:
```noformat
pip install --upgrade --editable path/to/botroyale[dev]
```

> **Note:** rerun this command any time the project metadata or requirements change (see `botroyale/pyproject.toml`).
