# Installing Bot Royale

It is recommended to use a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). Once activated, install using:

```noformat
pip install --upgrade botroyale
```

That's it! You now have Bot Royale installed in Python. See the guide on [writing your first bot](bots/simple.html).
