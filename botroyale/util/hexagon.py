"""Home of the `botroyale.util.hexagon.Hexagon` class.

The Hexagon represents a whole-number point in hex-space. It can also be
thought of as a whole-number vector from the `ORIGIN` (0, 0, 0) in hex-space.

### Coordinates
See the offset (x, y) coordinates with `Hexagon.xy` and the cube (q, r, s)
coordinates with `Hexagon.cube`.

Hexagons are normally not created manually, rather are returned from methods of
existing hexagons. To create a new Hexagon instance, see `Hexagon.from_xy`,
`Hexagon.from_qr` and `Hexagon.from_floats`.

### Neighboring hexagons
`Hexagon.neighbors` will return a hexagon's 6 nearest neighbors:

```python
import botroyale as br

hex = br.CENTER  # Hexagon(0, 0, 0)
neighbors = hex.neighbors  # tuple of the 6 nearest hexagons
assert hex.neighbors == hex.ring(1)
```

`Hexagon.doubles` and `Hexagon.diagonals` together make up the second ring:
```python
import botroyale as br

hex = br.CENTER  # Hexagon(0, 0, 0)
assert set(hex.ring(2)) == set(hex.doubles) | set(hex.diagonals)
```

### Distance
To find the hex-wise distance between two hexagons, use `Hexagon.get_distance`:
```python
import botroyale as br

hex = br.Hexagon.from_xy(5, -6)
distance_from_center = hex.get_distance(br.CENTER)  # 8 tiles distance
```

### Range
To find all hexagons *within* a certain distance, use `Hexagon.range`:
```python
import botroyale as br

hex = br.CENTER  # Hexagon(0, 0, 0)
tiles_in_range = hex.range(3)  # tuple of the 37 hexagons within 3 distance
```

### Ring
To find all hexagon *at exactly* a certain distance, use `Hexagon.ring`:
```python
import botroyale as br

hex = br.CENTER  # Hexagon(0, 0, 0)
tiles_in_ring = hex.ring(3)  # tuple of the 18 hexagons at exactly 3 distance
```

### Straight line
To find hexagons in a straight line, use `Hexagon.straight_line`:
```python
import botroyale as br

hex = br.CENTER  # Hexagon(0, 0, 0)
neighbor = hex.neighbors[0]  # A neighbor of hex

# The first hex that continues the line from hex to neighbor
next_in_line = next(hex.straight_line(neighbor))

# Iterating through hexagons in a straight line
for hex_in_line in hex.straight_line(neighbor):
    ...
```

### Rotation
To find a hexagon from rotation, use `Hexagon.rotate`:
```python
import botroyale as br

hex = br.Hexagon.from_xy(-2, 18)
mirrored_hex = hex.rotate(3)  # the hex on the opposite side of the origin
```

### Operators
Hexagons are also vectors, and can be added and subtracted:
```python
import botroyale as br

hex1 = br.Hexagon.from_qr(1, 2)
hex2 = br.Hexagon.from_qr(-1, -2)
center = hex1 - hex2  # equivalent to br.CENTER
```
